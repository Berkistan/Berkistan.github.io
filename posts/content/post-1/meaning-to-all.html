            <h1>Meaning to all of this</h1>
            <p class="p"> 
                For centuries humans have pondered what the meaning to our existence is.
                 What are we here to do? What is the right way to live life? How does one get to the truth?
                  Although many answers have emerged none of them have been able to assert themselves as the 
                  undisputed truth. Despite conventional religions filling the existential void for centuries
                   they have not managed to survive the scrutiny of the human mind. <br><br> 

                   Philosophies too have been vigorously questioned. And after nearly 200,000+ years of human
                    history we’re still not any closer to an objective “truth”. There seems to be no way for
                     us to find the undisputed “why” of the universe. Nihilism and Existential for instance 
                     completely accept the idea that there is no inherent meaning in why we’re here. However, 
                     existentialism argues that although it’s impossible to find a reason you have the 
                     capacity to create your own “why”. <br><br> 

                    With that said, it’s useful to first talk about why religion's proposition is dubious 
                    and why one should doubt it.  When we look at the most famous religions in the world 
                    (i.e Islam or Christianity), we see stories reminsient of fairy tales. Can a virgin really
                     give birth to a child? Can a man with no prior knowledge of how to build ships save his
                      followers by building a giant ship and then loading hundreds of both humans and animals
                     onto it? <br><br> 

                     Furthermore, is it rational for one to argue that anyone that does not believe in their
                      ideology will go to a bad place called hell? Think about the numbers, in our world 
                      today there are 1.7 billion Muslims and 2.38 Billion Christans. If only Christans or 
                      Muslims were going to go to heaven for merely having faith, that means the vast majority
                       of the world would perish in hell. We’re talking about at least 5 or 4 billion people
                        burning for eternity. <br><br> 

                    Additionally, how we understand religion is quite unreliable as well.
                    First a prophet sent by God is given revelations. Then those revelations are compiled 
                    and mass printed by believers. And then other people have to interpret and preach these
                    revelations to you. The number of abstraction layers that comes with religion, even if
                    we assume the initial information is true, can turn it into a relatively unreliable 
                    source of knowledge. <br><br> 

                    However, that does not necessarily mean religion has no utility. Pi from the movie 
                     The Life of Pi has a great quote about the distinction between fiction & reality:
                      “The world isn’t just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in
                       understanding something, we bring something to it, no? Doesn’t that make life a story?”
                        To give you some context, the ship Pi was on sank and during the movie he makes up 
                        this story of being stuck on a lifeboat with a tiger. Turns out the tiger was
                         actually a human. <br><br> 

                    And even more fascinating is Pi apparently had made up the story to cope with 
                    witnessing the barbaric behavior of the other person. Initially the boat had a few 
                    people but as time went on the “tiger” ate the other people and Pi was faced with the 
                    option of either being eaten by the “tiger” or satisfying it to not die.
                     Although he managed to not get killed by the “tiger” he was shocked by seeing a human 
                     kill other humans to survive. Therefore, instead of telling the real story to journalists
                      he made up a story about the other person being a tiger.<br><br> 
                      
                    The point is, life really is made up of our perception. None of us see things for what 
                    they are. We’re all observing life through the lens that is made up by our experiences,
                     emotions, relationships, and so on. Thus one might argue there isn’t much objectivity in 
                     life aside from science, the empirical study of the universe. So perhaps religions are
                      right despite the logical fallacies and lack of logical or empirical proof of their 
                      truth. <br><br> 

                      But they’re not necessarily right because they come from a “divine power” but rather 
                      because they are stories humans tell themselves to cope with the existential burden
                       that comes with being alive. Afterall storytelling plays a large part in our existence.
                        Growing up we’re told stories about kids that behaved well and got rewarded for being
                         good. In fact, even Math, the most logical subject in our world, is taught through
                          stories; remember the stories about Person A having 3 apples and Person B having 2
                           apples? <br><br> 

                    With that said, how about the question of how to live a good life? Although it’s near 
                    impossible to assert the virtue of a specific lifestyle, it is possible to find useful 
                    things one can do to increase their quality of life. <br><br> 

                    One of those things is to be a curious creator and explorer. It does not take much work 
                    to look at ourselves and see the curious creator and explorer urging us to learn as many
                     things as possible and create meaningful things. Think about it, humanity started as
                      hunters and gatherers around Africa or the Middle East but eventually got bored and 
                      started to move all around the place, from Europe to Asia to the Americas.
                       While exploring our world we also attempted to create technology and tools that 
                       amplified our natural powers. <br><br> 
                       
                     Unfortunately, the majority of humans today commit themselves to soulless corporate 
                     jobs that destroy the curious explorer / creator within them. Most parents refrain
                      from encouraging their kids to be curious about the world around them and instead
                       force them to follow conventional life trajectories and believe in societal norms,
                        notions, and traditions. Questioning things is still frowned upon in most societies 
                        around the world. <br><br>
